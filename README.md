CS3041_ManPageHelpApplication
=============================

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamahartman/CS3041_ManPageHelpApplication/master/screenshot.png)

This is a little application for reading structured versions of man pages. There are only a few man pages in it right now, so this is really only a proof on concept.

I wrote this for CS3041 - Human Computer Interaction at WPI. This was assigned by the professor, David Brown, so credit goes to him for the main idea.

I took this to make myself learn JavaFX stuff a bit. Not sure it follows best practices or anything, but hey, its something.

The man pages read into the program (from manpages.xml) came from Michael Kerrisk's online man pages here: http://man7.org/

The breadcrumb buttons were adapted from this guy's blog: http://ustesis.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/implementing-breadcrumbs-in-javafx
